# Casino-Game

Project to create a series of text-based Casino games, developed in Visual Studio with C++.
Games/Options include:

1. "Higher or Lower": A random number guesser that chooses two randomized numbers, one as the predictor and the other as the actual value. 
The objective is to guess if the actual value is higher or lower than the predictor.

2. "Blackjack": The classic card game, you and the dealer will both receive two cards, with your objective to get as close to 21 without going over.
If you can get a higher score than the dealer without going over 21, you win.

3. "Save System": Utilizing a text file for saving the player's score data and in-game money accumulated from playing the mini-games.
The file checks for existing users with the same name, to see if they want to overwrite the data.

To be implemented: 
  -  planning to create an additional mini-game utilizing more data structures.
  -  loading system to go with current save system (to overwrite your current information)
